Findborg Comet Joomla 3 Template Framework
I am building this primarly for use on Findborg.com but I welcome anyone to use it and contribute.
I have set it up so that it is a familiar layout to those who work with templates built upon the Gantry Framework.
However,  the module position names are about the only thing the same.

Here are a few of the things that I am tackling.

1:  I hate the fact that all the templates these days are built on Bootstrap and have no way of having a fixed sized sidebars.
    (I have solved that problem already)
    
2:  All the other frameworks are so hard to customize for the average Joomla user.  My goal is to try and make this framework
very easy to customize.

3:  Seperation of layout from mobile - tablet - desktop.  The framework needs to be able to load different layouts for each as well
as be responsive all the way down on the desktop.

4:  I want to use very little px.  Almost everything is em or rem based.  

Some of my biggest challenges are.  Finding a replacement for bootstrap dropdowns.(This is a tough one)
Joomla uses bootstrap at its core now.  So another problem is putting that in check.  Or,  figuring out a way to play nice with
it all the while having a more "readable" front end experience.

I will set up a demo,  and a group in findborg recall as soon as I get a chance.  If you can not wait for the demo you can visit
http://findborg.com and see it.  Ofcourse,  you will be looking at a work in progress..
